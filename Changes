{{$NEXT}}

2.101110  2010-04-21 11:06:52 EST5EDT

  - clarified that .XXXXXX versions of the CPAN-Meta distribution will not
    change the meaning of the CPAN::Meta::Spec, but may fix typos or
    clarify prose

  - fixed a typo regarding dotted-integer versions: keeping components
    in the range 0-999 was corrected to a "should" instead of a "must"

  - fixed validation bugs for certain types of nested data structures
    (based on a patch provided by Barbie)

2.101091  2010-04-19 06:32:13 EST5EDT

  - keep the old specs from getting indexed so as not to confuse people
