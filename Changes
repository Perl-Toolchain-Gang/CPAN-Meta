Revision history for CPAN-Meta

{{$NEXT}}

  - improve conversion of restricted/restrictive license keys between
    spec versions 1.4 and 2 [reported by Alexander Hartmaier]

2.101591  2010-06-08 09:56:17 EST5EDT

  - added 'as_struct' method to CPAN::Meta to get a deep copy of
    the metadata hash_ref

  - won't add an optional_features 'description' field if missing

  - improved documentation of CPAN::Meta::Converter and how it deals
    with bad/missing data

2.101590  2010-06-07 21:49:36 EST5EDT

  - won't automatically add 'unknown' as repository type when converting; 
    instead, will only add a repository type if a repository 'url' is
    present and it is of the 'svn:' or 'git:' scheme.

  - squelched some uninitialized value warnings [Graham Barr]

2.101580  2010-06-07 16:44:13 EST5EDT

  - add "lazy_validation" option to constructors

  - add ability to "convert" to same version and clean-up any fixable
    errors

  - fix validation bugs (adhere closer to the spec)

  - improve lots of heuristics during conversion

2.101461  2010-05-26 16:57:02 America/New_York

  - accessors deep clone list and map keys before returning them

  - add custom_keys() and custom() methods

2.101460  2010-05-25 23:12:27 America/New_York

  - loosen URL validation -- only a scheme and authority are required
    without restrictions on either

2.101450  2010-05-25 17:59:32 America/New_York

  - when downconverting from 2, leave custom keys unchanged
    (except in resources, where x_ is changed to X_)

  - when converting to 2, don't prepend x_ to custom keys that already
    matched qr{\Ax_}i

2.101410  2010-05-21 10:39:18 EST5EDT

  - when downconverting from 2, merge test requirements into build requirements

2.101390  2010-05-19 10:49:50 EST5EDT

  - do not clobber generated_by when converting

2.101380  2010-05-17 23:39:23 EST5EDT

  - added support for down-converting to older versions of the spec

  - improved test coverage for conversion and validation

2.101110  2010-04-21 11:06:52 EST5EDT

  - clarified that .XXXXXX versions of the CPAN-Meta distribution will not
    change the meaning of the CPAN::Meta::Spec, but may fix typos or
    clarify prose

  - fixed a typo regarding dotted-integer versions: keeping components
    in the range 0-999 was corrected to a "should" instead of a "must"

  - fixed validation bugs for certain types of nested data structures
    (based on a patch provided by Barbie)

2.101091  2010-04-19 06:32:13 EST5EDT

  - keep the old specs from getting indexed so as not to confuse people
